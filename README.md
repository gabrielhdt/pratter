# [Pratter](https://forge.tedomum.net/koizel/pratter)

By Gabriel Hondet

Pratter allows to transform strings of symbols and mixfix operators to full
binary trees.
Pratter is convenient for parsing languages made of terms with many mixfix
operators with different associativities and precedences such as
arithmetic or Î»-calculi.
In contrast to parser generators, parsing rules can be edited dynamically.

## Getting started

To compile and use pratter, you need

- ocaml >= 4.08
- dune >= 2.7
- camlp-streams

Then, at the root of the source tree,
```command
$ dune build
$ dune install
```

You can try the library in the toplevel: the following code defines a parser
for the language made of strings interspersed with infix `+` operators:
```ocaml
# #require "pratter";;
# type t = A of t * t | S of string;;
type t = A of t * t | S of string
# let appl t u = A (t, u);;
val appl : t -> t -> t = <fun>
# let is_op = function S "+" -> Some Pratter.(Infix Left, 0.3) | _ -> None;;
val is_op : t -> (Pratter.operator * float) option = <fun>
# Pratter.expression ~appl ~is_op (Stream.of_list [ S "x"; S "+"; S "y"]);;
- : (t, t Pratter.error) result = Ok (A (A (S "+", S "x"), S "y"))
```

## What next?

- There's a [change log](./CHANGELOG.md).
- There's a [license](./LICENSE).
- [This file](./t/simple.ml) is another use case example that is slightly more
  involved than the one in this readme.
